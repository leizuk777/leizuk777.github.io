                    <p>The one emotion for me that always comes up pairing sessions would have to be excitement or as DBC refers to it as an "aha" moment. I choose this emotion because its the one that helps motivate you through DBC and all the work we do to move from unit to unit. It helps regenerate your enthusiasm, especially if you are starting to let harder coding problems bring you down. The moment you figure out an issue or a bug is like hitting the last shot buzzer beater. It gets you excited to do more. When this type of emotion occurs in pairing its almost like a huge weight is lifted off your shoulder.
                    <br><br>
                    Kind , actionable and specific feedback to me is a productive criticism that helps the other person learn their strengths and weaknesses that are noticeable to your pair. This type of feedback is key to being informative as well as kind. Anyone can write negative feedback but being able to write constructive criticism is the main focus. This way the person is learning what they do right and wrong, without getting down on themselves and being too negative.
                    <br><br>
                    Its a great learning tool and also helps tie into vulnerability. Sometimes it can be hard to point out and tell people what they do wrong. Its best to put yourself in their shoes and explain it the same way you would prefer to read it. Make sure it is detailed so they can learn and change those mistakes, as well as focus on what they do best. Being vulnerable to me is okay as long as you don't take things to personally and let the negatives turn into positives. This is the best way to approach the DBC way.
