      I believe the DBC expierence is going to be a very new to me which is exciting and scary at the same time.  At first I was a little nervous about what was required to become a DBC student. But after watching the way they teach communicate as a whole has really eased my nerves. The way they have created a system for all levels of expierence to work together is very reassuring. My impression is that its going to be a very fast pace, but friendly learning enviorment. DBC encourages to learn from mistakes while other programs, I feel do the complete opposite. Im very excited to jump into this enviorment because I feel it will full benefit me although I am a bit nervous. I think after I get my first full day on site I will be ready to roll.
